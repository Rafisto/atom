# Quick introduction
Just a few words of introduction, as I go through this I see this only covers around half of this year, so it's not really everything. This is also nowhere near enough to understand Polish history, but I believe that it will at least help you get trough what we've done this year. I do realize that this is probably tottaly different history than what you've been learning throughout all those years in Ukraine, so I left some addnotations leading to wikipedia (or my own) here and there regarding Polish politicians, different stages of a country, etc. <br/>
I also gathered some of the most common proper names used during our lessons, that might appear in future untranslated as those are quite hard to translate, and even I myself couldn't get some of them right while translating those notes.<br/>

* [Duchy of Warsaw - Księstwo Warszawskie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Warsaw), name of Polish country, dependant on Napoleon's France

* [Kingdom of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland) or [Congress Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_Poland) (in Polish those are most commonly the same) - Królestwo Polskie<br/>
* [Vistula Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vistula_Land) - Kraj Nadwiślański
* Serfdom - Pańszczyzna
* Landowners - Ziemiaństwo

# Economical and social situation in XIX century in Poland
### Industrialisation
* People migrating from countries to cities
* Granting property rights to peasants (buying / getting lands):
    * Germany - begining of XIX century
    * Austria - year 1848
    * Russia - year 1864

Children starts to be more and more expensive to maintain, slowly starts to not be perceived as goods (workers on fields)

### Working groups:
* 75% - pessants
* 17% - workers
* 5% - intelligence
* 2% - Businessmans
* 1% - field owners

### 3 Processes of peasant conversion
* Personal rights (freedom) - year 1807 in Duchy of Warsaw
* Tenancy - (tenancy instead of serfdom)
* Enfranchisment - giving fields to peasants or giving them possibility to buy fields for themselves

### Situation of pessants
* Multigenerational families with loads of children
* Bad material situation (straw rooftops, often people and animals living in one building, seperated only by wall)
* No perspectives of education for children
* Children helping parents in field
* Peasants present great audience to politicians

### Situation of workers
* Working women and children - cheap workforce
* 10 to 12 working hours
* Some factory owners used to build **workers' housing estates**, with good infrastructure (schools, hospitals)

### Economy and society on Polish Territories
* Small lones to polish citizens, to enable them to start small businesses - shops, workshops, etc.
* Financial support for poorest families, like schoolarships, funded by the richest - [organic work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_work), in future will be associated with communist movements
* Landowners does not posses noble titles, and corresponding privilalges
* Partitioned Poland used to be very diversified, mostly under Russian occupation

### Prussian Occupation:
* Dominance of Poles in countries, dominance of Germans in cities
* Jews (~3%) had good education, were rich, usually assimilated with germans
* [Kaszubi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashubians)/Warmiacy(those are some of the biggest Polish subcultures)<br/>
Strong regional identity, loyal to region and traditions (supported poland during [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles)), didn't identify as neither Poles nor Germans

### Austrian Occupation
* Poles mostly in west parts, in cities
* Ukrainians in estern parts, virtually only countries (I do realize, that this can be different than what you were taught)
* Jews ~10% - 9 out of 10 speaked in polish
* Germans and Ormians (most commonly [Armenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians))

# November Uprising
### What's needed for successful uprising?
* Weapons High quality military equipment (Polish Army)
* People Civilian backup - enlistments
* Leaders Polish military generals reject to lead the chaotic, in their opinion, uprising, insurgents murdered 7 generals, because of their negative approach
* Plan
* Logistic
* Realistic motivator, purpose of the uprising - independence
* Secret intelligence
* International approval

<br/>
Civilians were afraid of repressions in case of defeat in uprising. <br/>
<br/>
The initial night was a tragedy. Some people want to carry on fighting, the others try to negotiate settlement with Russia. <br/>
National elders take the initiative, trying to settle down the situation. -** [Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kazimierz_Czartoryski) **and** [Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciszek_Ksawery_Drucki-Lubecki) **<br/>
<br/>
Prince Drucki-Lubecki went to Moscow to negotiate, although Russians didn't want to listen to him. Mission was a failure.
<br/><br/>
Radicals, against the idea of settlement with Russia take the initiative in Warsaw, and deprived Tsar of Polish crown. This triggers russian reaction and initiates war.
<br/>

### Effects:
* Contributions
* Autonomy limitations
* Country name changed from **Kingdom of Poland** to **Vistula Land** (Nadwiślański)
* Replaing Zloty with Russian Rouble
* Russification of schooling and administration
* Shutdown of higher schooling, parliament, goverment, army, constitution
* Multiple executions
* Deportation of children deep into Russia

# New Ideologies (begining of XIX century)
### General views

* Liberalism - **CHANGES**, also radical ones, big emphasis on freedom
* Communism - **Radical revolution**, world without classes, everyone being equal, **getting rid of the private property** (even as an idea), **no countries**
* Socialsim (social democracy) - Equality and **social justice**, common education, improvement of living conditions of working class,  **manufacturing communities**, **welfare state**

### Genesis
* Conservatism as reaction to dynamic changes in world (French Revolution)
* Liberalism molded by Enlightment philosophy and French Revolution ideals
