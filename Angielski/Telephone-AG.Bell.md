U.S. patent 174 465 
Telephone is a device first patented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. It is used for the transmission and reception of a human voice. Due to the science behind electronics, such communication 
established is then immediate, or as we may call it works in real-time.
Working principle: 
Suppose we have a person speaking in this direction.
The energy of their voice makes the air vibrate. 
Those sound waves are then transformed by the microphone.
The circuit is constantly changing its resistance
resulting in an analogue signal being sent to the wires.
Then on the other side the wires are connected to the speaker,
which converts the signal back to the sound waves.
The aftermath
Here is the thing, we had already been able to use the telegraph so what is the matter? 
The matter is convenience and speed.
Using the telegraph consists of many steps. Imagine you wanted to send a message in the 1850s.
You had to: 
- Walk to the local post office. Wait in the queue.
- Give your message on paper. Wait until it is being sent.
- Wait until the other post office gets the message
- Wait till they deliver it to receiver.
- And… repeat, to get a response.
20 years past you are sitting in your house 
speaking with your friend over a telephone.
Simple as that. You put his number, wait
half a minute and boom, you can talk.

People also started to realize that there is a big difference between text and speech. The language started to evolve in the way to be more optimized.

Speech by its very nature brings us close together, makes different groups communicate with each other.
That being said, it is no surprise that the effect on economy and business was enormous.
Trades became more common, as now anybody could phone a company to make an inquiry.
Life became faster.
That’s all I have for this quick presentation.
